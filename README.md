# QR Code Component Project

## Overview

This project is a simple front-end component that displays a QR code along with some text. The design is meant to be clean, minimalist, and responsive, using a combination of custom CSS and the Google Fonts API.

## Files Included

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- **style.css**: The CSS file containing all the styles for the webpage.
- **images/**: A folder containing the `image-qr-code.png` which is used in the project.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The standard markup language used to create the structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: The styling language used to design the appearance of the page.
- **Google Fonts**: The project uses the "Outfit" font from Google Fonts.
- **Responsive Design**: The project is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring that it looks good on various screen sizes.

## Structure

- **Container**: The container class centers the content on the page and gives it a nice white background with rounded corners and a shadow for a card-like appearance.
- **Title and Text**: These are styled with specific fonts and colors to ensure readability and a good visual hierarchy.
- **Image**: The QR code image is fully responsive, ensuring it scales well on different devices.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the QR code component in action.
3. You can replace the `image-qr-code.png` in the `images` folder with any QR code you want to use.

## Customization

- **Fonts**: You can change the font by modifying the `@import` line in the CSS file.
- **Colors**: The colors are defined using CSS variables at the beginning of the `style.css` file. You can easily change them by modifying the values.
- **Image**: Replace the `image-qr-code.png` in the `images` directory with your desired QR code image to customize the content.
